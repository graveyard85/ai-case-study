Overview and Origin

Palantir Technologies was incorporated in 2003 by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal), Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp. Mr. Thiel’s initial vision was to apply software to counteract terrorism through financial analysis. The company struggled in the early years to raise funding with a modest $2M from the CIA and an additional $30M from Thiel’s finances, as well as funding through Founders Fund, a venture capital firm led by Thiel. Palantir secured additional funding in 2013 of over $600M based on contracts awarded by the government and solicited additional funding in 2014 and 2015. Palantir resisted an Initial Public Offering (IP), believing the publicly traded model would not be in the company's best interest. However, Palantir went public with an IPO in September 2020 on the New Your Stock Exchange with the symbol PLTR.

Initially, Palantir focused on the intelligence community in partnership with the CIA. It was determined that artificial intelligence (AI) alone was insufficient to provide the analysis needed and instead focused on intelligence augmentation by using human analysts to dive deep into the data produced by Palantir. 

Landscape

Since then, the company’s offerings have grown to include AIP, an AI platform running on private enterprise networks, and other software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms named Foundry, Gotham, and Apollo. Palintir’s software continues to be used by intelligence agencies and deployed in various industries, from financial services, energy, defense, healthcare, semiconductors, telecommunications, utilities, and railroad transportation.

Results

In recent years, Palintir has found formidable competition from Amazon Web Services, Databricks, and ServiceNow in both the SaaS and AI sectors, which has placed pressure on the company’s valuations, decreasing from a high of $20B down to around $9B today. Palantir continues to focus on software solutions for enterprises seeking to augment their operations with advanced AI models to increase efficiency and reduce cost. 

In the intermodal rail sector, industry leaders CSX Transportation and CN Railway have partnered with Palantir to produce AI models to mitigate service disruptions through advanced analysis of predictive maintenance, rolling stock utilization, and strategic deployments of assets to ensure profitable load balancing through the network. The railroad realized $20M in savings from parts and repairs as well as a reduction in spending on capital assets through Paintir’s efforts.

Recommendations

One of my thoughts from reviewing the materials was the adaptation of these models in other logistics operations. The industry where I have spent most of my career could benefit from similar models for predictive and preventative maintenance, redistribution and deployment of critical assets, and machine learning technologies to augment the human capital that traditionally handles these decisions throughout the organization.
